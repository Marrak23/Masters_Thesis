This repository is uploaded
after handing my master's
thesis. It
describes the master's
thesis on Quantum Reaction
Dynamics for Early- and
Late-Barrrier reactions.

Some Matlab code is attached.
The code is open source, but
an Apache license 2.0 as
described from the following
source (visited 12 april
2024):
https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/4887/is-it-appropriate-to-use-open-source-license-with-matlab-code

Feel free to reach out to me, Octavus
Schmidt, if you have any questions.
